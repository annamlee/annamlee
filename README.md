## Hi there! I'm Anna ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a third year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business Economics, with a keen interest in building user-oriented applications and utilizing the curious power of code to solve problems.

When I'm not in the computer world, I enjoy exploring new places, going to concerts, grabbing boba, reading, and playing the guitar.
